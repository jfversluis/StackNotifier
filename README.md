# StackNotifier
I used to keep an open tab to StackOverflow and refresh it every once in a while. So, I decided to turn it into a Chrome extension so data will come to me instead of the other way around!

Simply add the tag(s) you want to be notified about separated by semicolons, determine a refresh interval and you're done!
